% Does Octave use while loops?
% How do you add an element to a list in Octave?



% Set an index i,j on stim,rho ?

% define an empty list


% Is there a spike?

    % if rho = 1, then move marker to this spot
    % if rho = 0, then move marker to next spot, repeat

% get the average for the last 300 ms

    % average = average of the stim's
        %   [value at marker, value at marker-1, ..., value at marker-150]

% put that number in a list

    %

% move on to next element

    % if there are more elements in the list, advance marker, repeat loop
    % end when there are no more elements in the list

% finally, take the average of the list

    %

% output the answer







THIS ISN'T WRONG, IT JUST DOES SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE WANT


% initialize an index, i

i = 1;

% set up a loop (while i is in range)

while i <= num_spikes(1)

    % find the first (or next) spike. Note that time as t

    t = spike_time(i);

    % find the spike-triggered average leading up to t
    % add that number to the list, sta

    sta(i) = mean(stim(t-150:t));

    % move to the next spike

    i = i + 1;


% end for loop

endwhile


% finally, find the average of sta

            % DELETE?

            y = spike_time(i);

            data_points(i,j) = stim(y);

            NEXT y =
